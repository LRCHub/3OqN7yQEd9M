I've held my tongue, but I've gotta say this
I'm wearing thin and running low on self restraint
A bus stop from home, but still it's getting too late
You turned your back on me so I say bye, bye, bye

You've got a fighting pose
So let it show, oh, oh

I wish the world that I have seen inside my dreams
Where everything is fine with peace of mind could be, but no
We're stuck in this reality of worrying
About such stupid little things in our endless rolling days

Even though you keep falling head first
You always laugh it off every single time
I step on the bus and see the back is empty
I take a seat and notice as you flash a smile

I'll follow where you go
Just so you know, oh, oh

The sweetest love that I have seen inside my dreams
Where distant lovers find each other where the world cannot reach, but
We're stuck in this reality, still struggling
These days we always keep, I wanna leave these endless lonely days

Oh, yeah, oh, even if you stumble on you go, yeah, yeah
A worn and muddy rolling star

It brings me so much pain to see your smiling face now
But until the end I will do everything I can
There's no meaning in a life
And there's none, none at all in mine
All my loving
That's not it, I know this isn't right

I wish the world that I have seen inside my dreams
Where everything is fine with peace of mind could be, but no
We're stuck in this reality of worrying
About such stupid little things in these endless rolling days

Oh, yeah, oh
Now that you've grasped the concept
Oh, yeah, oh
Even if you stumble on you go, yeah, yeah
A worn and muddy rolling star
